# Rain Prediction

This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning techniques. It leverages Python libraries for data processing, visualization, and model training.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy` 
- `pandas` 
- `matplotlib` 
- `seaborn` 
- `scikit-learn` 
- `pickle` 

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Code Breakdown

```python
import numpy as np  
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import seaborn as sns  

from sklearn.utils import resample  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score  
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier  
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score  
import pickle  
```
