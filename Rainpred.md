# Rain Prediction

This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning techniques. It leverages Python libraries for data processing, visualization, and model training.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy` 
- `pandas` 
- `matplotlib` 
- `seaborn` 
- `scikit-learn` 
- `pickle` 

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Code Breakdown

```python
import numpy as np  
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import seaborn as sns  

from sklearn.utils import resample  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score  
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier  
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score  
import pickle  
```

`import numpy as np` imports the NumPy library, which is used for numerical computations in Python.\
`import pandas as pd` imports the Pandas library, which is used for data analysis and manipulation in Python.\
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` imports Matplotlibâ€™s Pyplot module for creating visualizations like graphs and charts.\
`import seaborn as sns` imports Seaborn, a Python library for making statistical data visualizations.\
`from sklearn.utils import resample` imports the `resample` function from **scikit-learn**, which is used for **random sampling, bootstrapping, and data balancing** .\
`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score` imports functions for **data splitting, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation**.\
`from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier` imports the **RandomForestClassifier** for **building ensemble-based classification models**.\
`from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score` imports functions for **evaluating model performance**.\
`import pickle` imports the **Pickle** module for **saving and loading Python objects**.\

## Code Breakdown

```
data = pd.read_csv("/content/Rainfall.csv")
```
`data = pd.read_csv("/content/Rainfall.csv")` loads the **"Rainfall.csv"** file into a Pandas DataFrame for data analysis.

## Code Breakdown

```
data.head()
```
